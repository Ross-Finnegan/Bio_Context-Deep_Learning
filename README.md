## Project for Month 1:

Description: Apply a deep learning model to a genomic or RNA-Seq dataset. You can use publicly available data from resources like the NCBI's Sequence Read Archive (SRA).
* Week 1: Exploratory data analysis and data preprocessing.
* Week 2: Implementing and training the model.
* Week 3: Evaluating the model and fine-tuning.
* `Week 4: Writing a project report and preparing a presentation or blog post about your work. Make sure to highlight the problem you addressed, your approach, the challenges you encountered, how you resolved them, and your results.
