# Genomics: A Very Short Introduction - John Archibald (2018)
Will explore the science of genomics and its rapidly expanding toolbox.
* Broad overview
* The molecular biology upon which genomics is based
* Examples of the scientific questions it is used to address
* How it impacts our daily lives
* How it is likely to do so in the future

### 1. What is genomics? ###
* Genome - the sum total of DNA inside the single or multiple cells of an organism. This includes non-coding DNA.
* Humans have two genomes - one in the cell nucleus and the other in the mitochondrion.
* Cell is the fundamental unit of life. Two main types:
    1. Prokaryotes - microscopic, single-cell. Bacteria, E-Coli in gut. Archaea
    2. Eukaryotes - numerous membrane-bound compartments. Nucleus, mitochrondrian, chloroplasts. Cytoskeleton - protein based internal scaffolding system that allows eukaryotes to change shape and size.

* Viruses are neither prokaryotes or eukaryotes. (More in Chapter 6)
