### 1. What is genomics? ###
* Genome - the sum total of DNA inside the single or multiple cells of an organism. This includes non-coding DNA.
* Humans have two genomes - one in the cell nucleus and the other in the mitochondrion.
* Cell is the fundamental unit of life. Two main types:
    1. Prokaryotes - microscopic, single-cell. Bacteria, E-Coli in gut. Archaea
    2. Eukaryotes - numerous membrane-bound compartments. Nucleus, mitochrondrian, chloroplasts. Cytoskeleton - protein based internal scaffolding system that allows eukaryotes to change shape and size.

* Viruses are neither prokaryotes or eukaryotes. (More in Chapter 6)
* DNA spiralling ladder - steps built from nucleotides which contain a negatively charged phosphate on the outside, a so-called base on the inside and a sugar linking the two.
  * Four bases in DNA: Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G), Thymine (T)
  * A-T and C-G. These are the 'base pairs' (bp)
* DNA replication - pull two strands of the double helix apart. Once apart, the cell uses each single strand as a template for the sequential addition of complementary nucleotides. End result is two DNA double helices.
  * Extremely accurate but not perfect
  * During this process most mutations in DNA arise.
  * The complimentary nature of the two strands of DNA means only one strand needs to be sequenced
* The mechanism by which genes mediate the synthesis of proteins also involves separation of the double helix.
  * One of the two DNA strands serves as a template for the production of RNA.
    * Sugar in RNA is ribose, not deoxyribose
    * Ribonucleotide bases are A,C,G, and U (uracil)
  * While DNA and RNA are linear chains comprised of nucleotides, proteins are polymers of amino acids.
  * There are 20 different types of amino acids in naturally occurring proteins.
  * Genetic code used by all cells is a triplet code, each particular amino acid is 'encoded' by a three-base 'codon'.
    * These are converted into RNA in a process called transcription. mRNA is then used as a template for the synthesis of proteins.
    * During translation, amino acids are linked together in a linear fashion in the precise order specified by the codons in the gene.
  * Protein synthesis is a remarkably complex process.


* The first genome sequenced was in 1976 - an RNA virus named MS2, a bacteriophage that infects E Coli and related bacteria.
* MS2 as simple as genome can get: ~3,600 bp long and only 4 protein-coding genes.
* First DNA-based genome sequenced was the bacteriophae phiX174 (5,400 bp and 11 protein-coding genes)
* Human Genome: 3.2 billion bp. 2m of DNA packed into the nucleus of each of our cells. 
  * Unknown how many genes. Current estimate 19,000-25,000. Many reasons:
    * Only ~1% of human genome corresponds to protein-coding genes & genes themselves are broken into pieces.
    * In eukaryotes, the codon-containing regions of genes 'exons' are interrupted by stretches of non-coding DNA - introns.
    * Introns are transcribed into RNA but removed (spliced) before the molecule is used as a template for protein synthesis. Human genes often have dozens of introns
    * Distinguishing exons from introns and other forms of non-coding DNA is challenging.
    * Molecular biologists have developed various techniques for honing in on just protein-specifying codons but tools are still far from perfect.
    * Related issue: large regions of human genome have yet to be sequenced due to technical challenges associated with sequencing certain types of DNA such as repetitive strings of nucleotides


* Genome-sequencing tend to focus on protein-coding genes, all cells possess a variety of non-coding RNA genes whose functional end product is the RNA molecule itself.
* Including  ribosomal RNAs, which are RNA components of the protein-synthesizing ribosome, and transfer RNAs. RNA understanding is still growing immensely.
